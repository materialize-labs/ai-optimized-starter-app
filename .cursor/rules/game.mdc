Gamification Features

Confetti Celebration:

When a user completes a production cycle (i.e., all machines have finished processing a part), trigger a confetti animation on the screen.
Consider using a JavaScript library like confetti.js or tsParticles to create visually appealing confetti effects.
Efficiency Points:

Develop a points system based on the user's efficiency.
Award points based on how close the actual production time is to the standard cycle time.
For example:
Meeting the standard time: 10 points
Completing within 5% of the standard time: 8 points
Completing within 10% of the standard time: 5 points
And so on...
Deduct points for exceeding the standard time or for downtime occurrences.
Point Multiplier for First Part (Setup):

Since the first part often involves setup time, consider applying a point multiplier to the first part's efficiency score.
This incentivizes users to optimize setup procedures and reduce setup time.
Streaks and Bonuses:

Implement streaks for consecutive production cycles completed within the standard time or a specific efficiency threshold.
Award bonus points for achieving streaks.
Consider adding daily or weekly challenges with bonus points for completion.
Leaderboard (Optional):

If you have multiple users, create a leaderboard to display rankings based on points earned.
This fosters friendly competition and motivates users to improve their efficiency.
Badges and Achievements:

Introduce badges or achievements for reaching certain milestones, such as:
"Efficiency Master" for consistently meeting standard times.
"Downtime Warrior" for minimizing downtime occurrences.
"Setup Speedy" for optimizing setup times.
AI Agent Instructions for Cursor

Confetti Implementation:

Use a JavaScript library (e.g., confetti.js, tsParticles) to create and trigger confetti animations.
Ensure the animation is visually appealing and doesn't obstruct critical information on the screen.
Points System Logic:

Develop the logic for calculating points based on efficiency.
Implement point multipliers for first-part setups.
Create a mechanism for tracking streaks and awarding bonus points.
Leaderboard (Optional):

If applicable, create a leaderboard to display user rankings based on points.
Ensure the leaderboard is updated in real-time or at regular intervals.
Badges and Achievements:

Design badges or achievements with clear criteria and visual representations.
Implement a system for awarding and displaying badges to users.
User Interface Integration:

Integrate the gamification features seamlessly into the user interface.
Display points, streaks, badges, and the leaderboard in an intuitive and engaging manner.
Data Storage:

Add necessary columns to the Supabase tables to store points, streaks, badges, and leaderboard data.
Ensure data is stored and retrieved efficiently.
AI Considerations:

Explore how AI can be used to personalize the gamification experience.
For example, AI could analyze user performance and suggest areas for improvement or tailor challenges based on individual skill levels.
Additional Tips

Keep the gamification elements optional. Allow users to enable or disable them based on their preferences.
Provide clear feedback to users on their performance and how they earn points.
Regularly update the gamification features with new challenges, badges, or rewards to maintain user interest.
