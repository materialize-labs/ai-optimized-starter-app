## Migration Strategy

The Manufacturing Efficiency Tracking System requires a migration from the existing contact application to a comprehensive industrial tracking platform. This document outlines the strategy for this transformation while preserving core architecture.

### Overview

We're preserving the core infrastructure of the app while significantly expanding its capabilities to include manufacturing-specific entities and relationships.

### Completed Work

#### 1. Database Schema Migration

A comprehensive SQL migration file has been created at `supabase/migrations/20250310_manufacturing_schema.sql` containing:

- Enums for `user_role`, `machine_status`, and `downtime_reason`
- Tables for manufacturing hierarchy (companies, sites, value streams, cells)
- Tables for production tracking (machines, production logs, downtime logs)
- Tables for metrics and analysis (efficiency metrics, bottleneck analysis)
- Row-level security policies and performance indexes for all tables

An additional migration for parts has been created at `supabase/migrations/20250325_parts_schema.sql` containing:
- Parts table with machine cycle times and bottleneck information
- Associated row-level security policies
- Performance indexes

#### 2. TypeScript Schema Definitions

Drizzle schema files have been created at:

- `db/schema/manufacturing-schema.ts` - For company, site, value stream, and cell entities
- `db/schema/production-schema.ts` - For machines and logs
- `db/schema/metrics-schema.ts` - For efficiency metrics and bottleneck analysis
- `db/schema/parts-schema.ts` - For parts and their cycle times

Updates have been made to existing files:
- `db/schema/profiles-schema.ts` - Added role field
- `db/schema/index.ts` - Now exports all new schemas
- `db/db.ts` - Updated to include all new tables in the schema object

#### 3. Server Actions Implementation

Created server action files for:

##### Manufacturing Hierarchy:
- `actions/db/companies-actions.ts` - CRUD operations for companies
- `actions/db/sites-actions.ts` - CRUD operations for sites
- `actions/db/value-streams-actions.ts` - CRUD operations for value streams
- `actions/db/cells-actions.ts` - CRUD operations for cells
- `actions/db/user-assignments-actions.ts` - CRUD operations for user assignments

##### Production:
- `actions/db/machines-actions.ts` - CRUD operations for machines with status updates
- `actions/db/production-logs-actions.ts` - Start/complete production cycles
- `actions/db/downtime-logs-actions.ts` - Log downtime events
- `actions/db/parts-actions.ts` - CRUD operations for parts with cycle times

##### Analytics:
- `actions/db/efficiency-metrics-actions.ts` - Calculate efficiency metrics
- `actions/db/bottleneck-analysis-actions.ts` - Identify bottlenecks

All server actions include:
- Input validation using Zod
- Proper error handling with structured responses
- TypeScript typing for params and return values
- Consistent patterns following project standards

#### 4. Core UI Components Implementation

Developed manufacturing-specific UI components following Next.js App Router architecture:

##### Production Tracking:
- `app/manufacturing/page.tsx` - Main production tracking page with proper server/client pattern
- `app/manufacturing/_components/hour-x-hour-tracker.tsx` - Real-time production tracking component
- `app/manufacturing/_components/production-tracker-skeleton.tsx` - Loading state for production tracker

##### Efficiency Analysis:
- `app/manufacturing/_components/efficiency-dashboard.tsx` - Dashboard for visualizing efficiency metrics
- `app/manufacturing/_components/metrics-skeleton.tsx` - Loading state for efficiency metrics

##### Part Management:
- `app/manufacturing/_components/new-part-dialog.tsx` - Dialog for creating and editing parts
- `app/manufacturing/_components/parts-manager.tsx` - Component for managing parts

##### Setup Times:
- `app/manufacturing/_components/setup-times-manager.tsx` - Interface for managing machine setup times

All components follow the frontend architecture guidelines:
- Server components for data fetching
- Client components with "use client" directive for interactivity
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for props and data
- ShadCN UI for consistent component styling
- Responsive design patterns

### Next Steps

#### 1. Apply Database Migrations

```bash
# Run this command to apply the migrations
supabase db push
```

- Verify all tables appear in the Supabase dashboard
- Check that relationships are properly established
- Confirm RLS policies are functioning as expected

#### 2. Complete Production Tracking UI

- Finish the Hour X Hour tracker implementation:
  - Fix any remaining TypeScript errors in calendar components
  - Complete the production cycle completion functionality
  - Implement lunch break and time difference tracking
  - Add proper error handling for all user interactions

- Add additional production visualizations:
  - Implement attainment percentage indicators
  - Create time-series charts for production efficiency
  - Add machine utilization displays

#### 3. Implement Hierarchical Navigation

- Create company/site/value stream/cell navigation components
- Implement dropdown selectors for filtering data by hierarchy level
- Add breadcrumb navigation for current context

#### 4. Finalize Analytics Dashboard

- Complete efficiency metrics charts using Recharts
- Implement date range selection for historical analysis
- Add bottleneck detection visualizations
- Create export functionality for reports (CSV/PDF)

#### 5. Add Role-Based Access Control

- Implement permission checks based on user roles
- Create admin interface for role management
- Restrict access to sensitive operations based on permissions

#### 6. Optimize Performance

- Implement proper data fetching patterns with Suspense
- Add caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
- Optimize component re-renders with proper memoization
- Ensure responsive design across all screen sizes

#### 7. Add Real-Time Updates

- Implement WebSocket connections for live data updates
- Add notifications for critical efficiency changes
- Create real-time collaboration features

### Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Completed): Database schema migration
- **Phase 2** (Completed): Server actions and basic UI components
- **Phase 3** (In Progress): Production tracking UI completion
  - Hour X Hour tracker finalization
  - Part management interface improvements
  - Setup time configuration
- **Phase 4** (Next): Analytics dashboard development
  - Efficiency metrics visualization
  - Bottleneck analysis tools
  - Historical data reporting
- **Phase 5**: Role-based access and permissions
- **Phase 6**: Real-time functionality
- **Phase 7**: UI polish and performance optimization

### Architectural Considerations

Throughout this migration, we're maintaining:
- Server/client component separation following Next.js best practices
- Strong TypeScript typing for all components and data
- Consistent UI patterns using ShadCN components
- Proper loading states with Suspense boundaries
- Accessibility considerations for all interactive elements

This approach allows us to leverage the existing codebase while completely transforming its functionality to serve as a sophisticated manufacturing efficiency tracking system.
